# Calibration
#   - Calibration, or GREG estimation, allows continuous as well as discrete auxiliary variables.
#     The method is motivated by regression estimation of a total but can be computed simply by reweighting, using the calibrate() function.
#     The method is described for estimation of a total in SÃ¤rndal et al Model Assisted Survey Ssampling; 
#     we use the same approach to estimate the total of estimating functions.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# This example uses the same dclus1 survey design as above. 
# First we calibrate to the school type variable.
# We supply a formula ~stype and must specify population totals for the design matrix produced by this formula.

pop.totals <- c(`(Intercept)` = 6194, stypeH = 755, stypeM = 1018)

dclus1g <- calibrate(dclus1, ~ stype, pop.totals)

summary(dclus1g)



# We could also have given the formula as ~stype-1, with no intercept,
# in which case the population totals would have been simply the three stratum sizes.


# ----------
# Calibration to a single factor variable is equivalent to post-stratification

svytotal(~ enroll, dclus1)
svytotal(~ enroll, dclus1g)


svytotal(~ stype, dclus1)
svytotal(~ stype, dclus1g)



# ----------
# We can calibrate using the two variables stype and sch.wide, as we did with raking.

dclus1g2 <- calibrate(dclus1, ~ stype + sch.wide, c(pop.totals, sch.wideYes = 5122))

# Calibration to 1999 API
#    - Finally, we can look at a calibration example with a continuous variable.
#      Imagine that the 1999 API is known for all schools but the 2000 API is known only for the sample.
#      Since there is a high correlation between 1999 and 2000 API (see the graphics example for a scatterplot),
#      calibrating to 1999 API reduces the uncertainty in mean 2000 API considerably.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We can calibrate the sampling using the statewide total for the previous year's API
