# ----------
# the idea of Zelig is that statistical results are typically only intermediate quantities needed to compute your ultimate quantities of interest,
# which in the case of matching are usually causal inferences. 
# To get these causal quantities, we use Zeligâ€™s other two commands.

# ----------
# Next, we use the coefficients estimated in this way from the control group,
# and combine them with the values of the covariates set to the values of the treated units.
# We do this by choosing conditional prediction  (which means use the observed values) in setx().

# ----------
# In this calculation, Zelig is computing the difference between observed and the expected values.
# This means that the treatment effect for the control units is the effect of control (observed control outcome minus the imputed outcome under treatment from the model).
# Hence, to combine treatment effects just reverse the signs of the estimated treatment effect of controls.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Subclassification
#   - In subclassification, the average treatment effect estimates are obtained separately for each subclass, 
#     and then aggregated for an overall estimate.
#   - Estimating the treatment effects separately for each subclass, and then aggregating across sub-classes, 
#     can increase the robustness of the ultimate results since the parametric analysis within each subclass requires only local rather than global assumptions.
#     However, fewer observations are obviously available within each subclass, and so this option is normally chosen for larger data sets.
