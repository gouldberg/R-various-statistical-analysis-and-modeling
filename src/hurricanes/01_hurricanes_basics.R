# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# data:  Hurricanes
#   - In 2014, a paper was published that was entitled "Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes".
#     As the title suggests, the paper claimed that hurricanes with female names have caused greater loss of life, and the explanation
#     given is that people unconsciously rate female hurricanes as less dangerous and so are less likely to evacuate.
#   - Statisticians severely criticized the paper after publication.
#     Here consider the hypothesis that hurricanes with female names are deadlier.
#   - Variables
#        - damage_norm:  Normalized estimate of damage in dollars
#        - min_pressure:  Minimum pressure, a measure of storm strength, low is stronger
