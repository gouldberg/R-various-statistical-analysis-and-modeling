# For GLMs with discrete responses, such plots are often disappointing, even with a reasonably good-fitting model, because
# (a) possible outlierrs can appear at both the lower and upper ends of the distribution of residuals
# (b) the theoretical normal distribution used to derive the envelope may not be well approximated in a given model
