# R-various-statistical-analysis-and-modeling
- Here, R language scripts of data exploration, analysis and modeling for various science research areas and approaches.
- **Under the 'src' folder**, there located folders named by **target dataset**, which means the scripts under 'abc' for example are for data exploration, analysis and modeling using the 'abc' dataset. Some datasets are analyzed and modeled in various ways/approaches/libraries.
- Sorry that R version for this script is a bit old (a few years ago), so some libraries imported may not be applicable now.
- Great fun for analysis and modeling by R launguage ...
